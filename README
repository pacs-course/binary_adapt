Configuration files:
"./binary_tree.conf" to configure the parameters of the algorithm

"./quadrature_rules/sandia_quadrature/include/sandia_quadrature.conf" to configure the sandia quadrature rule
"./interpolating_functions/include/interpolating_functions.conf" to configure the muparser expression
	remember to set the muparser functor in "binary_tree.conf" if you want to use the muparser framework
